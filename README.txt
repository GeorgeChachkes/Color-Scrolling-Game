The player controls a character that moves around the screen. When 
it hits a colored circle the character changes to that color. The character has
to avoid the colored walls coming at it, but it can pass through walls that are
the same color as itself. For example, if the users character was green, the user
is allowed to hit a green wall. If any other color walls are hit, though, the 
user loses the game. They have to survive 45 seconds to win, and in the last 15 
seconds of the game everything speeds up.
